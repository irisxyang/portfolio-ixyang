# Design Evaluation: Crumbl as a Software Company

Crumbl is a cookie company that has been trending lately for its extremely high calorie sweets (~1000 calories PER COOKIE) and weekly rotating flavor menu. However, at its core, Crumbl is actually centered around its technology and software--the co-founder Jason Mcgowan was a software engineer, and decided to develop an entirely new point-of-sale (POS) system specifically for Crumbl so that they could customize their customer loyalty program for their specific goals. In Lecture 13, we learned about various design evaluation techniques that are used in order to get user feedback. A lot of Crumbl's success comes from the ways that they used the user data from the Crumbl POS software, using methods like the ones covered in lecture in order to help improve the Crumbl cookie user experience.

Accelerated by the unique circumstances of Covid, Crumbl's app evolved to operate as an ordering app and in-company social media all in one. In addition to placing curb-side orders, the app allowed Crumbl's team to publicize the weekly rotating menu. On the Crumbl internal side, they integrated a "crew newsfeed" where Crumbl could post instructions and tips for how to make the best cookies for customers. The "in-house" operating system also allowed Crumbl to accommodate for their constantly changing menu, since they could automatically update the recipe for all of their bakers at once.

Apart from the clear utility from the efficiency of information access across the company, Crumbl also gains a major advantage from having access to all of their customer data. Below are some of the main benefits and evaluation techniques that Crumbl uses:

1. **Minimizing R&D Costs:** They can selectively release cookies only to certain locations before releasing them to the general public, so that they can get sufficient customer reviews in order to perfect their recipes and minimize losses in the case that a cookie is not a hit with consumers.
2. **A/B Testing Across Selected Locations:** In order to actually optimize their cookie recipes, Crumbl slightly tweaks the ingredients of recipes across the few different selected locations. They can then analyze the customer response in order to actually determine which recipe was more preferable for consumers. In my opinion, crowdsourced A/B testing for cookie recipes is one of the main benefits of having incredibly specific and accessible customer data.
3. **Accessing Sales Information for Data Analytics:** They can easily access sales information for different products to perform analytics without having to get limited data through a third party.
4. **Customer Survey and Immediate Crowdsourced Feedbacks:** They can easily integrate surveys into their customer experience, allowing for widespread and efficient collection of feedback. Crumbl posts QR codes at the selected recipe testing locations for customers to rank flavor and texture of their recipes in development.

I thought this was an extremely clever business move for Crumbl. By creating their own software, Crumbl is able to access all of their customer information and massively cut down on R&D costs to improve their consumer experience. Although I personally think their cookies are disgusting, I can't help but admire Crumbl's incredibly efficient usage of data and design evaluation tactics.
