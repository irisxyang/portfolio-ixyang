# Obsolete Metaphors in User Interaction Design

Lecture 11 introduced User Interaction Design. I thought the section about "speaking the user's language" was particularly interesting in the context of the spread of technology. From the examples in class of the early IOS interfaces, we can see that apps such as the Recording app, Notes app, and Newsstand were designed in a way that was heavily inspired by their original literal function. It speaks to the principle of discoverability, since new users are able to cross-apply their previous knowledge about the physical objects to the virtual concepts.

However, as technology has become more widespread, the principle of discoverability has also evolved with user needs. 20 years ago, there was still a large portion of the market that did not have much experience with touchscreen interfaces. Nowadays, almost everyone knows how to operate a touchscreen phone, and using functions such as the Clock app or the Notes app are considered to be common knowledge. As a result, UI design has become more and more abstracted since companies no longer need to invest as much thought into discoverability.

I think one especially fascinating side effect of this is that certain "metaphors" that were used in original iterations of technological interfaces have actually become obsolete. For example, the "Save" icon (pictured below) was originally modeled after a floppy disk, which essentially became obsolete by the 2010s. The phone icon is modeled after retro phones that are rarely used anymore. It's incredible how these icons have gradually taken over a new, yet essentially the same meaning over time. Some more examples are the folder icons (modeled after physical files), or a tab (inspired by tabs in folders).

With the expansive reach of technology, users as a whole begin to assign new meaning to design conventions, which meant that companies could take advantage of this new "common knowledge" and be more flexible in their design choices. This phenomonen is not just apparent within the more obvious design components like icons, but also with the overall interface itself. In 2013, Apple introduced their "flat" IOS update, which took away the highlights and shadows that gave their interface depth (i.e., the fall of skeuomorphism). Personally, I think that it's great that the companies have more creative freedom in their interfaces. It's almost an indication of our progress in technology--the baseline standard for technological knowledge just keeps getting higher.

Although companies are able to concentrate more on aesthetics as a result of a lesser focus on discoverability, accessibility thus becomes a huge issue that companies need to be extremely careful to accommodate for. The prevalance of flat interfaces right now means that companies have to be more aware of color contrast. There has also been a rise in simplicity and minimalism, which lead companies to create boring designs with less distinctions between different components. Furthermore, the shift away from discoverability means that those who are unfamiliar with technology might experience more difficulty navigating modern-day interfaces. With the increasing capabilities of technology, it might be argued that there is no excuse for a company to not accommodate for accessibility. How can companies navigate the boundary between meeting their aesthetic goals, while also accommodating for those that might need acessibility modifications?
