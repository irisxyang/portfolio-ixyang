## Part 1: Background

Evelyn, a 22 year old new-grad working in Finance in New York.

**What was your experience with eating out at restaurants throughout your life?**

- Never ate out during the week as a kid, except Sunday brunch every week (same place) and Saturday night ("Beef O'Brady's", bar food)
- Restaurant experience was more family oriented
- Later as she started swimming more, Mom brought take out from fast casual chains (Chick Fil A, Jersey Mike's) after 7pm-9pm practices
- At MIT, didn't go out too much but would go with friends if they got sick of dining hall--nice way to get off campus
- Now in New York, food is definitely better than Boston in terms of quality
  - Higher demand for reservations makes it much more of an experience/event to go out and eat

**What kind of role do you think food plays in your life?**

- Something to look forward to
- Even if not traveling, a way to try something new and keep things exciting/unexpected
- Easy way to see friends--you have to eat anyway!

## Part 2: Restaurants

**What restaurants have you tried recently? How did you find these restaurants?**

-
- Uses lists on Beli, but those are very much tailored towards "Top 10" "Top 20" etc.
  - Don't really need to be going to Michelin star restaurants, typically very expensive
  - Will use as a starting point, but not the most useful
- Also uses "Recs" feature on Beli, helpful for finding places that are a certain cuisine or close in distance
- If not planning in advance would just use Google and go based off of star rating since she can find way more options
- Sadelle's: New York (near her apartment), brunch, aesthetic, bagel towers
  - All options are great, said exceeded expectations
- Hamburger America: New York (near her apartment), fast casual, really good burgers
  - Best burger she's tried
  - Care less about the service because it is a cheaper place

**What do you think you prioritize when searching for a restaurant to eat at? What factors influence your decision?**

- If trendy (there is demand for it)--likely means there is some combination of higher quality or something new/special or fun atmosphere if busy
- Don't want to go to an empty place (easy reservation), but don't want someplace like Carbone (no reservations)
- More exciting to prioritize restaurants where reservations are "tougher"--makes you feel accomplished and cool for dining there

**Do you enjoy trying new restaurants? Why?**

- Like that things in New York are so specialized
- Likely to have dishes never heard of
- Outdoor seating, explore different neighborhoods

_Do you think you enjoy trying restaurants more in New York versus Boston or other places?_

- Yes, because the average restaurant is much better
- Cost of living is higher, more people, higher demand means restaurants need to be better to be competitive

_What determines what restaurants you would want to go back to?_

- Combination of either 1. reasonably priced or 2. one thing that's better than all other places (ex: Hamburger America has best hamburger ever), or 3. all items at restaurant are good
- If case 3 (no standout item but overall well rounded) then environment and service come into play more
- Prioritize taste and hype and then environment

**What kind of things do you prioritize when reviewing a restaurant? What factors do you think influence what you choose to highlight in a review?**

- Taste, service, abiity to try different things and taste multiple dishes (like Sadelle's)
- Also highlight things that are unexpected (reservation super easy, just walked in, service amazing, etc.)

_So is service really important to you? Is it a dealbreaker?_

- Service important as it stands on its own. Higher price point means better service should be more required, but lower cost wouldn't care as much about service
- Story: Fancy italian place (top 3 in West Village),founder of Beli used to have it ranked as a 9.9 but reranked it to “I didn’t like”
  - In the notes she said food is outstanding but service is SO bad--verbally abuse people with disabilities
    _How did you find this out?_
  - Found this out by literally just looking at the Beli and checking her ratings regularly

## Part 3: Social Media

**How much do you rely on social media when you are searching for restaurants?**

- Social media (Beli) has become sort of “word of mouth,” because people who are into food are on Beli
- VERY big in NY
- Review is basically a recommendation on Beli
- Spending free time with people not really talking about food / restaurants
- IG and TikTok are not really used to actively find restaurants

_What do you think of the restaurants that you find?_

- Very satisfactory from Beli

**Do you consume any food influencer content?**

- Not especially
- On TikTok, there’s one account that she keeps up with (“top 10 places we ate this month on Beli”) -- still Beli adjacent!!

**How do you treat restaurant-finding while traveling?**

- Didnt start ranking until got to NY

_What did you do before that in Boston?_

- Much more word of mouth, friends would have recommendations

**What do you think are the benefits and drawbacks from seeing food influencers promote certain restaurants?**

- Not really influenced by seeing videos fed by algorithm
  usually actively looking for restaurants

**What social media apps do you use when you look for new restaurants?**

- Beli, Resy for reservations (high demand), sometimes OpenTable / Yelp
- Yelp or Google Reviews more for reviews (if something isn’t on Beli)

_So do you find yourself choosing Yelp or Google Reviews?_

- Google is easier to use

_Just so I'm understanding this correctly: Would you only really use Resy or OpenTable in New York, just because the demand is so high?_

- Yes, fancy restaurants will hold back reservations (announce X time to see reservations), held for people who have already been there before
- Sometimes you have to go walk in pretty early (before 5), then you get added to the list for reservations that are held
- Fight for reservations is crazy

**Which one do you enjoy using the most? Why do you enjoy using this app?**

- Only post on Beli, maybe a TikTok but wouldn't really post on TikTok like that
- Only other time post pictures of food is on Strava (interesting)

_Why do you want to keep posting on Beli?_

- Similar to like on Strava, very social focused
- "Status symbol” something cool that you’re doing
- Like being able to look back, will forget that she went to a place and can look back and reflect on the review

_What about other review sites like Yelp or Google?_

- Not really a social thing on Yelp so no incentive
- Don’t know other users
- Only would post if had a really negative experience (for the public good)
- Beli is just for friends

**Has a food review app ever negatively impacted your experience with trying new foods?**

- Beli or apps similar to that (really focusing on top 10 restaurants, very fine dining etc.) makes restaurants WAY more busy. overhyped, etc.
- Never really gotten a bad restaurant from a review
