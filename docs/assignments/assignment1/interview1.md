## Part 1: Background

Jonathan, a 25 year old working in SWE in Seattle, Washington.

**What was your experience with eating out at restaurants throughout your life?**

- Didn't eat out much growing up, but since college has explored more with friends

_Why didn't you find yourself eating out a lot when you were younger?_

- Parents always preferred to eat in and make dinner

_When did you start eating out more at restaurants?_

- After junior year of college, did an internship in New York and started eating out more
- Didn't like the apartment that he was staying at, so wanted to spend more time outside
- So many options in NY

**What kind of role do you think food plays in your life?**

- Likes going out to eat, likes the experience of going to a new place + seeing what they offer
- Good way to meet people and hang out with people
- Now that past college age, good way to catch up --> increasing presence of social aspect in food leads to becoming more into food in general
- likes eating

## Part 2: Restaurants

**What restaurants have you tried recently? How did you find these restaurants?**

- Dave's Hot Chicken in Seattle:
  - found via friend who saw it on Instagram
  - big chain, appealed because it had a big internet presence
  - big deal when it opened in Seattle--had a viral trendiness + good casual spot to catch up with friends
- Antidote when recently visiting New York:
  - Found through a friend's Beli, who probably saw via Instagram
  - Friend really likes eating out as an experience, so he trusts their taste
  - This was more about experiencing the food/restaurant than just catching up
  - Venue and atmosphere was interesting
  - Menu was like authentic chinese but delivered in a "nicer" upscale place (vs your stereotypical run-down authentic chinese restaurant)

**Do you enjoy trying new restaurants? Why?**

- The andicipation is most exciting about trying new restaurants
- Like when you get excited about watching a movie. finding a place, deciding on it, getting there, exciting to sit down and open the menu and try something new

**What kind of restaurants do you enjoy trying?**

- More food-focused than experience/ambience focused
- Food can only be so good, past that point you're paying for a nice venue and good service

**What part of the eating-out experience do you like?**

- Picking from the menu, choosing different options and trying new things
- If with other people, enjoy the social aspect of it
- At a restaurant, you can't do much else except eat and talk

**What do you think you prioritize when searching for a restaurant to eat at? What factors influence your decision?**

- Flavor and cuisine--prefers asian/chinese cuisines
- Price is second priority
- Doesn't take into account customer service
- To an extent cares about what the venue looks like--i.e., wouldn't discount it if the venue is run-down but would be a bonus if the venue is good

_Would you rather go to restaurant that's more popular/crowded, or do you not care?_

- Don't really care, would not want to go somewhere that is empty, though

**What kind of things do you prioritize when reviewing a restaurant? What factors do you think influence what you choose to highlight in a review?**

- Would only talk about taste and how good it was flavor-wise
- Doesn't really care about customer service and stuff

_What about a cafe-style, where you might be doing other things such as working?_

- Would care more about venue itself and "customer experience"--wifi, good seating, outlets, cleanliness

## Part 3: Social Media

**How much do you rely on social media when you are searching for restaurants?**

- Almost entirely

_You mentioned you get a lot of your recommendations from your friends. Are you personally ever actively looking?_

- Not really, algorithm will deliver food content
- using Beli a lot because it's easier to get a personalized recommendation
- Getting through friends or social media helps pre-filter out the options and tell you what you might or not
- Doesn't really use Google Reviews or Yelp
  - Too many people on the sites, too many things to rate it on so everything starts evening out
  - Everyone thinks different things
  - Also a lot of restaurants have high reviews so it makes it harder to choose
  - Want to go to restaurants that are more in his demographic (i.e. stuff his friends would also go to)
- Goes depending on if he thinks it looks good or not, doesn’t particularly prioritize trendy locations vs local favorites

**Do you consume any food influencer content? What do you think are the benefits and drawbacks from seeing food influencers promote certain restaurants?**

- Not intentionally, don't follow food accounts for locations (such as Seattle food, etc.). If sees on social media "organically," will take note

_Do you trust food influencers?_

- Certain ones, depends on what style of content it is
- Is it trendy/optics based, or is it actually good?
- Cross reference different apps (IG, Beli, Google, NYT)
- Easy to distinguish between Buzzfeed aesthetic stuff vs real foodies
- Would not trust sponsored content

**How do you treat restaurant-finding while traveling?**

- Go back to Google Reviews/Maps (most available), or Reddit
  unless happening to get that location’s content on their fyp, then need to search up

_Usually, I wouldn't think to consider Reddit a food review social media. What do you think you gain from going on Reddit versus a different app?_

- Likes Reddit: less prone to sensationalism than IG bc it’s not visual. harder on Reddit to go viral, so it’s real people that are answering

**What social media apps do you use when you look for new restaurants?**

- Beli, Instagram, Google Reviews, Reddit, Tiktok (when still downloaded)

**If multiple, what influences your decision to use one versus the other? What is the main "selling point" of each?**

- Instagram: visual, video form content. easy to consume. so many content creators on it, can get a lot of recs very easily. they also do the effort of trying it for you. big network to pull from
- Beli: more personal. people on Beli are more serious (more foodie). being able to see people you know + where they’ve been going
- Reddit: if you’re in a new place and don’t know people there, and want real people reviews, reddit is last resort
- Google Reviews: if you’re just hungry and need something quick (don’t have time to do research) will pick a 4-star place and just go

_Why not Yelp vs Google Reviews?_

- Because they’re similar, Google is a lot more convenient bc didn’t want to download another app. Yelp doesn’t really add more information than Google

**Which one is your most used? Why is this your most used app?**

- Recently has been Beli because you know people where you live. would probably pick Beli over Google Reviews now in terms of most used
- Use Beli because it’s a whole dedicated app for food, tend to trust opinions more bc the users have more experience with restaurants
- Ranking is mainly based on taste for him--likes being able to rank it on his own scale
- Google Reviews has so many reviews, so all the opinions end up cancelling out and hard to tell what’s good or what isn’t

**Which one do you enjoy using the most? Why do you enjoy using this app?**

- Don’t really particularly “enjoy” them

_What do you mean by this?_

- Don’t think Beli is very well designed: a lot of features, but not intuitively organized
  - Looks like had a bunch of ideas and threw it on there, seems cluttered and a lot of features that aren’t actually being used
  - Don’t think the app is organized very well/intuitively
  - Weirdly unintuitive to even add a restaurant--every button leads to like 10 more buttons, need to keep clicking through to get to what you want
  - A lot of overlap between the different tabs, don’t use all the features (didn’t even know some existed)
  - Do like the reservation sharing feature, think that’s a cool and useful addition

**What factors do you think influence your decision to keep using a certain app and continue posting or consuming content?**

- Success rate of finding good restaurants on that app--# of hits gotten off Beli / IG have been pretty good, always end up liking it. the "filter" is working
- Beli is easy _enough_ to use that it doesn’t matter, but if it was any harder he wouldn’t bother posting more stuff, which would affect his recommendations
- Don’t post content anywhere except Beli

_Why do you only find yourself wanting to post on Beli?_

- Don’t feel the need to be posting on other stuff, Beli is more like a personal log. don’t feel need to share on public story and publicize it (influence other people)
- Like being able to look back on the ranking list on Beli

_What do you think sets Beli apart from other review apps where you could also get a compiled list (like Yelp, etc.)?_

- Likes the ethos of the app, like the idea of it being more foodie specific. already using app for that, nice to keep the info there.
- You’re sharing your review to everyone on Yelp, etc. like having it being more small circle/personalized. dont like posting publicly!
- Beli will use your ranking to tell you what you think you’ll like, trust those rather than Google

**Has a food review app ever negatively impacted your experience with trying new foods?**

- Not from any app experience, only gotten bad recs from people
- With food apps it is easier to customize rec based on what you like vs other people
- Apps usually give good or just okay recs, not just bad (i.e. have been somewhere that’s underwhelming, but not actually bad)
