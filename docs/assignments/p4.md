## Concepts Implemented

In our code, we have created the infrastructure for most of our concepts.
We are in the process of finishing up all of the syncs, and have implemented an extremely basic front-end for testing the two completed concepts: Grouping (Project) and Tasking. We have also started loosely creating the visual aesthetics of our app.

## Basic Front-End Explanation

In the interface, a user must log in. Then, they can create a project, add members, assign tasks to members, etc.

Only the project's creator can add members or create new tasks. For the home page, only tasks for the current session's user are displayed (since this is the "User Home")--so to see task assigning functionality, create a task assigned to yourself for a project that you are the creator of.

Right now, functionalities are limited by the single-page format, which is why Project IDs are being used as input fields. In the future, we plan to implement a store to store which project we are currently "looking at", and all of the input forms will be on separate pages of the app. For now, this suffices as a primitive testing interface for our concepts.
