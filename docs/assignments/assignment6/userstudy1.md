# User Study 1 (Unedited): Anne

## Task 1: Basic Registration

- No trouble navigating to registration page
- User weighting description was not the most concise, but after the "for example" it was clear
- Liked the hover detail on the buttons
- Registration worked smoothly
- "Glad you're back" didn't make sense logging in for the first time
- Log out was a bit hard to navigate to, took a bit of time: confusion navigating to "Settings" tab

## Task 2: Restaurant Exploration

- Smooth navigation to Restaurant Search page via Home Page -- sufficient direction on screen
- Search is case sensitive
- Review formatting is aesthetic and cute, easy to read
- Weighted averages not refreshing (displaying NaN)
- Would have been nice to be able to click anywehre in the box instead of just on the Restaurant title text to navigate to the restaurant page
- Generally makes sense and is intuitive

## Task 3: Reviewing

- Navigating to the Add Review page made sense from Home Page
- Reviewing for a restaurant was pretty straightforward
- Liked the button interface for inputting scores

## Task 4: I Didn't Like That Review... (Review Deletion)

- No issue figuring out how to edit a review, button was clear
- When editing a review, it resets the weightings to 0 instead of displaying original score
- Otherwise the interface worked fine
- Delete works well, pop-up was nice to show that it really was deleted

## Task 5: New Priorities (User Weighting Editing)

- Made sense to navigate to "Settings" to change user weightings
- The interface worked well but did not correctly update the weights
- Confused on the user weightings because not correctly displaying

## Debrief: Thoughts and Impressions

**What worked well?**

- Really liked the interface visual design: things were organized and clear
- Liked the font choice
- Flow of site was generally pretty intuitive, some aspects did not work as expected

_Which aspects didn't really work as you thought they would?_

- Expected the search to be insensitive to capitalization
- Expected restaurant component to be able to be clicked on as a whole, not just the title

_Why was this unintuitive for you?_

- View the restaurant component as a whole button, since there is not really other information on that component that would need to have alternate linking

**What do you think could be improved on?**

- Some of the bugs in the app, such as the weightings not being updated or displaying/calculated correctly
- Some of the button presses and page navigation or locations were unintuitive
- Could have a better explanation for the weightings--not super clear at first
- Was not sure how the weightings affected the weighted averages at first
