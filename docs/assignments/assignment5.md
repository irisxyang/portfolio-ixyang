# Frontend Design and Implementation for Omnom

## Heuristic Evaluation

### Usability Criteria

- **Pleasantness:** I think that my wireframe is relatively pleasant. It sticks to a relatively toned-down color scheme of a sage green, black, and white, which means that there are no overwhelming color clashes. Each box that encloses a review or component of the interface is not filled in with a different color--instead it is simply outlined in a black outline. The width of these black outlines is consistent across all components, regardless of their size, which means that there is no visual clutter from varying line widths. These all contribute to a relatively "pleasant" interface. However, I do think that some of the information in the review components can appear a bit unpleasant, because there tends to be a lot of text associated with each box. In particular, I think the attribute scores (food, service, ambience, price, and novelty) could be visualized in a way that is less crowded since it could appear overwhelming. Instead of representing the scores with more text, it could be helpful to create a more graphic approach to representing the score values such as having colored bars.

- **Accessibility:** I believe that my wireframes are relatively accessible. Although as mentioned before some of the components are a bit text-heavy, generally the font and colors are very accessible to those with visual disabilities. The contrast levels between overlapping text and colors are sufficiently high such that any user can reasonably identify and read the content. There are no issues with colorblindness, because my color scheme is extremely simple, and none of the components rely on color to convey information. I think that any other accessibility accommodations that I could add would be likely be out of the scope of this class.

### Physical Heuristics

- **Gestalt Principles:** I think that the layout of my wireframes generally follow Gestalt principle conventions in that they are intuitive in the way that they convey the structure of my concepts. For example, by using the principles of similarity and proximity, it is abundantly clear that different aspects of my interface are "grouped" together, such as the Reviews in the main feed, or the Groups on the right side of the user profile page. The nested boxes for the review also help convey the structure of my Reviewing concept by implying that every sub-box within the larger box is just a component of the overall review.

- **Mapping:** I think that while my wireframe does a good job at communicating the underlying concept of the design, it is not as good at conveying the underlying _function_ of the design--i.e., it does not do a good job of mapping. The layout of the elements definitely reflects the structure of my concepts, but it is not clear if, for example, a specific component is clickable like a button, or simply a non-interactive part of the site. This could be made clearer by creating a distinct format for components that are "buttons", which would provide a clearer mapping of the elements' functions for users.

### Linguistic Level

- **Speak The User's Language:** I think that my concepts in my wireframe do a good job of speaking in clear, user-friendly terms. I am unsure if this would fully qualify as a "metaphor", but I think the naming of the different characteristic weightings (food, service, etc.) as "Preferences" is a good example of this. I think this name does a good job of conveying the intention behind the concept, which is to encapsulate the user's opinion--hence, "preferences." There are no other components or concepts that I believe are extremely confusing, but one thing that I could implement in my final site to help with this principle is to create understandable and informative error messages for actions that the user is not allowed to perform.

- **Consistency:** My wireframes are relatively consistent across the different pages. Each Review component has the same layout, whether it is on the home page, restaurant page, or the user's profile page. This is great because it allows for the user to quickly navigate the information in any Review regardless of what page its on, since it is always in the same format. One thing that I could consider adding is consistent symbols across different pages (also tying into accessibility), which would further strengthen the principle of consistency across my site.
