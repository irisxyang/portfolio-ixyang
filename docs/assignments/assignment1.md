# Social Media Needfinding in Food Reviewing

## 1. Pre-Interview Planning

### 1.1 Hunch

| I would like to design a social media app for those who are enthusiastic about finding new restaurants to try, but might want to prioritize different characteristics of a restaurant based on their needs. Crowdsourced ratings on a single 5-star scale (like most current restaurant ranking apps use) donâ€™t show the nuance in user ratings, such as significant preference variations in atmosphere, service, and food quality, which means that personal opinions could vastly differ from a collective score. |

### 1.2 Personal Experience

<p> I love exploring the Boston food scene, and am always looking for new restaurants to try. However, the scoring system on different restaurant rating apps tend to have different biases, and are not always catered to my personal tastes. My hunch is that there is a gap in the industry to develop a more personalized crowdsourced restaurant rating system that can more reliably reflect or predict a user's opinion. </p>

### 1.3 Interviewee Selection

I am predominantly looking for people in their early-to-late twenties, which is the largest demographic for people who eat out regularly, according to the [International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity](https://ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12966-015-0210-8#:~:text=In%20adults%2C%20eating%20meals%20out,unadjusted%20and%20mutually%20adjusted%20analyses.). Also, based on their age group, it is more likely that they would be using social media to aid them in finding new restaurants. I also hoped to find subjects that were living in different areas, so I could explore any regional differences that might exist. Finally, I wanted to find people who were passionate about food and enjoyed trying new restaurants, as my hunch is focused around people who might want a more personalized restaurant recommendation experience.

My first interviewee is Jonathan, a 25 year old University of Washington grad living in Seattle, Washington working in SWE. My second interviewee is Evelyn, a 22 year old MIT grad living in New York City working in Finance. I chose these two interviewees because they live in different areas and graduated from different colleges, and thus might have different experience finding restaurants. Furthermore, I am mutuals with both of them on Beli (a food ranking app that is catered to "foodies") and both of them are active on the app. Since Beli is an app that is centered around ranking new restaurants, my assumption is that they must have experience exploring the food scenes in their respective areas. From brief conversations with the both of them, they both seem passionate about trying new restaurants. I hope that their diverse backgrounds might lend themselves to have different approaches to exploring new food, and possibly different priorities for what they look for in a restaurant.

## 2. Interview Roadmap

I decided to split the interview into 3 parts: Background, Opinions on Restaurants, and Social Media Focus. This format is meant to warm up the interviewee, starting with broad questions then getting more specific to the app as the interview goes on. Below is the general framework plan, but throughout the interviews, I added various followup questions and adapted as needed.

### Part 1: Background

- Basic information: Name, Age, Industry, Area of Residence
- What was your experience with eating out at restaurants throughout your life?
- What kind of role do you think food plays in your life?

### Part 2: Restaurants

- What restaurants have you tried recently? How did you find these restaurants?
- Do you enjoy trying new restaurants? Why? What specifically?
  - What kind of restaurants do you enjoy trying?
- What do you think you prioritize when searching for a restaurant to eat at? What factors influence your decision?
- What kind of things do you prioritize when _reviewing_ a restaurant? What do you choose to highlight if you were to give it a review? What factors influence what you choose to highlight?

### Part 3: Social Media

- How much do you rely on social media when searching for restaurants?
  - What do you think of the restaurants you find?
- Do you consume any food influencer content? What do you think are the benefits and drawbacks from seeing food influencers promote certain restaurants?
- How do you treat restaurant-finding while traveling?
- What social media apps do you use when you look for new restaurants?
  - If multiple, what influences your decision to use one versus the other? What is the main "selling point" of each?
  - Which one is your most used? Why is this your most used app?
  - Which one do you enjoy using the most? Why do you enjoy using this app?
- What factors do you think influence your decision to keep using a certain app and continue posting or consuming content?
  - Where do you post content? Why do you post content?
- Has a food review app ever negatively impacted your experience with trying new foods?

## 3. Interview Reports

### Interview 1: Jonathan

[Interview 1 Unedited Notes](assignment1/interview1)

#### Summary

Jonathan was a student at University of Washington studying Computer Science, originally from the Greater Seattle Area. After he graduated, he stayed in the Seattle area and is now working in SWE. Jonathan did not grow up eating out a lot, because his parents preferred to make dinner. However, during and after college, he found eating out at restaurants to be both a great way to entertain himself and an important way maintain his social life. When he does try new restaurants, he usually gets recommendations from his friends, or happens to come across popular restaurants on social media such as Instagram. He rarely actively searches for food, because he likes having personalized recommendations via his friends or apps--specifically, he likes that the recommendations from his friends or social media algorithms already "pre-filter" out the worse restaurants. Furthermore, he feels like his tastes are similar to that of his friends because they are in the same demographic. In terms of food review social media, he doesn't really use larger platforms such as Google Reviews or Yelp, because he feels as though there are too many people and too diverse of a sample set to get accurate, relevant rating information. He predominantly uses Beli, which is also the only app that he finds himself posting ratings on. He likes how Beli is a more intimate form of social media, which means that he feels comfortable posting his own reviews and trusts the recommendations that are given to him by the app. However, he also finds himself slightly frustrated with the Beli app interface, which he feels like is sometimes "doing too much."

#### Takeaways

Overall, Jonathan is an example of a more introverted user, who interacts with food review social media for his own personal needs--Whether it be entertainment, curiosity, or social interaction. He finds himself avoiding larger social media platforms for food such as Yelp or Google Reviews (unless for convenience reasons), because he thinks that the user base is too large and diverse to be relevant. He also finds that users of larger platforms have different priorities than him--he doesn't particularly mind the customer service or ambience of a restaurant since he is almost exclusively focused on the food and its taste. He values the "close friend" aspect of food review apps such as Beli, because he feels like he is able to get more accurate recommendations from those that are closer to him. He only posts on Beli, but interestingly, he doesn't post for the original purpose of a social media (i.e., to share content with other people). Instead, he uses Beli purely as a personal list that he finds himself referring back to. Also, he posts for the Beli recommendation algorithm, which improves with increasing data input. However, he doesn't find himself using some of the other more niche features, such as the Leaderboard.

### Interview 2: Evelyn

[Interview 2 Unedited Notes](assignment1/interview2)

#### Summary

Evelyn was a student athlete at MIT who graduated in the class of 2024. She was a member of the MIT Varsity Swimming Team. She is from South Carolina, and moved to New York after college to pursue an intense career in Finance. She didn't grow up trying a lot of different restaurants, since eating out was mostly just a consistent way to spend time with her family, or a way for her to get quick and convenient fuel after a swim practice. She began to branch out a little during college, but she really began to pursue her food exploration journey after she moved to New York. This was largely due to the culture: The high demand, populated environment of New York meant that the average restaurant was much higher quality. Most importantly, with the spike in popularity of Beli (especially in New York), she found herself trying new restaurants in order to post about them on the app as almost a status symbol. Because reservations in New York are often highly sought after due to the high demand, she finds it more exciting to try restaurants where it is harder to get a table--and thus is also more impressive when she is able to rank it on Beli. She says that it is similar to how she sees Strava, where posting a workout is usually something that she is proud of. She usually goes for restaurants that she finds trending on Beli, because those recommendations tend to be some combination of higher quality and having something new or unique. In terms of restaurants that she finds herself returning to, she prioritizes reasonable prices, having one menu item that is stand-out, or having an extremely well-rounded menu. If there is no specific stand-out item, she considers environment and service more. She heavily relies on Beli for discovering new restaurants, and says that the social media has become the equivalent of "word of mouth" to her, because she keeps up with her friends on the app. However, she does not find herself using the "Lists" feature on Beli, such as "Top 10 Restaurants," etc. because she feels as though they tend to be too expensive and high-end. She also follows Beli influencers, who are people that have ranked the highest number of restaurants in her area.

#### Takeaways

I interviewed Evelyn after my interview with Jonathan, and her perspective was extremely different from what I was expecting. Due to the busy and competitve social climate of New York--the dense population, the high demand for reservations, the higher quality of restaurants overall--she finds herself gravitating towards social media for its original purpose: social interaction and connection. I found that Jonathan was using social media more in an isolated, personal sense, Evelyn explained that she used Beli much like she used Strava--almost as a means of displaying social status, where posting a new restaurant is a sort of brag. I thought it was so interesting how much more she thought of restaurants as a social status symbol rather just a means of personal enjoyment. Like Jonathan, she values the opinions of her friends for recommendations, but she is also far more invested in the social _perception_ aspect of it.

## 4. Design Opportunities

### Close-Knit Social Interactions

Users seem to enjoy the more small-community aspect of apps such as Beli compared to larger platforms. Because food is such a social aspect of human interaction, even throughout history, the app should emphasize this in order to build a close-knit community amongst its users. Ideally, we would focus on design aspects that would help encourage these more personal interactions, such as having privacy settings that only allow you to view reviews from close friends. This would also affect the content on the main feed, such as only showing mutual friend reviews.

### Adaptability

From the user interviews, it was apparent that Jonathan and Evelyn treated food review social media in very different ways. However, they both mentioned that they felt as if larger platforms such as Google or Yelp were not personalized enough, especially because other users of those platforms appeared to have different priorities than they did. The design of this app should ideally be able to accommodate for the various wants and needs of different users, but maintain a consistent platform for everyone. An idea to implement this would be to allow users to rank and weight different characteristics based on their personal preferences, such as customer service of food quality. This would improve overall user experience by allowing for an overal more relevant, personalized experience.

### Relevant Recommendations

Users often have a diverse set of possible circumstances where they would want to eat out--for example, casually catching up with friends, or needing a quick bite, or going on a date. We would want to design an app that takes into account these needs, for example by asking users what they want to look for and filtering recommendation content based on factors such as distance, cuisine, and price. We can also compare data from a user's friends in order to create a more relevant recommendation to the user. It is important for a user to get relevant recommendations based in data so that the users will be incentivized to return to the app in the future.

### Easy To Use

The design of the app should be kept clean, simple, and easy to use. Users will be deterred from using features on the app if it becomes too cluttered, especially with unnecessary features. For example, both Jonathan and Evelyn mentioned that if they wanted a quick bite to eat, they would simply use Google because the interface is simple and information is clearly compiled on one platform. Ideally, we would have a simple and useable app interface so that it is convenient for users to find a new restaurant that matches their needs, and they would not reach for a different application.

### Creating Personal References

On top of the social aspect of the app, a big reason being why users continue to post on an app appears to be that it serves a personal use. For example, both Jonathan and Evelyn mentioned that they liked being able to refer back to their ranked lists of restaurants to see what they thought of the places they had tried before. On top of the social aspect of sharing a review, the user should be able to easily refer back to their previously reviewed restaurants. Furthermore, it should be formatted in a clear, intuitive way, and possibly have options to filter results. This would encourage users to continue to use to platform not just to share information with friends, but use as a personal guide.
